// These methods need to be implemented to return the partner id and site id that were provisioned by AdMarvel for your App.
- (NSString *)partnerId;
- (NSString *)siteId;

// Returns the view controller that will be responsible for displaying modal views.
// This is mostly used when the SDK needs to takeover full screen (such as when an ad is clicked).
// NOTE: As of iOS 6 the app now controls which orientations can be used by ads/in-app browser in either the Info.plist or in the AppDelegate application:supportedInterfaceOrientationsForWindow: method.
//       We recommend for maximum compatibility with RichMedia ads that your app enables all orientations and then programatically restricts orientations where necessary using the UIViewController supportedInterfaceOrientations method.
- (UIViewController *) applicationUIViewController;

@optional

// Optional NSDictionary containing targeting parameters for the user. Defaults to empty (which means all geo information will be taken from the device IP address).
- (NSDictionary*) targetingParameters;

// The rectangle where you want to display the ad.  The minimum size should be 300x50.  It defaults to CGRectMake(0,0,320,50).
// This is ignored for interstitial ads which are always full screen.
- (CGRect) adMarvelViewFrame;

// Return YES if you want to enable testing.  Defaults to testing not enabled (NO).
- (BOOL) testingEnabled;

// Return NO if you want to disable animations when a new ad displayed.  Defaults to animations enabled (YES).
- (BOOL) animationsEnabled;

// The color of the background behind the ad if it doesn't take up the full frame.  Defaults to clear.
// Note that the UI color should be specified using [UIColor colorWithRed:green:blue:alpha:] since grayscale values will cause issues in some cases.
- (UIColor*) backgroundColor;

// These items control the display of text ads.  The ads will be default to a black border, gray background and white text.
- (UIColor*) textAdFontColor;

// Controls for style of tool bar on full page web view that opens when an ad is clicked.  Defaults to black and UIBarStyleDefault.
- (UIColor*) fullScreenToolBarColor;
- (UIBarStyle) fullScreenToolBarStyle;

// Controls if location services enabled.  This is not required and only should be enabled if your app is already using location services.  Defaults to NO.
- (BOOL) locationServicesEnabled;

// If location services are enabled then this method will be called to get the users current location.  Returning nil means the user's location is not available.
// It is strongly suggested that apps that don't already have the user's location shouldn't bother requesting their location just for ad serving purposes.

// Callback that gets invoked when an ad is clicked on that has a special AdMarvel SDK URL.  This enables an ad click to trigger special functionality within the application.
// These special ads would be loaded through the AdMarvel campaign management UI.  The click URL must start with admarvelsdk:// (instead of http:// ) to trigger this callback.
// The SDK will not perform any action other than calling this callback method when an ad with this type is clicked.  Only the text after admarvelsdk:// will be passed in the urlString parameter.
- (void) handleAdMarvelSDKClick:(NSString*)urlString;

// Callbacks to let the app know that an ad has just expanded or collapsed.  This means that an ad is taking up part of the screen but interaction with various elements of the app may still be possible.
// If it has expanded then the ad is currently currently displaying over some of the content.  The app should keep track of this and call collapseAd if the user interacts with the app instead of the ad.

// These callbacks are useful if your app needs to pause any onscreen activity while the interstitial is being viewed and restart after it is closed.
// These are optional since fullScreenWebViewActivated and fullScreenWebViewClosed will be called as well in case only those are implemented.
- (void) interstitialActivated;

// Callbacks to let app know that the banner would like it to disable rotations.  Enable will only be called to reset rotations if disable was previously called.
// This is most often used when the user has begun to interact with an ad and the exprerience on rotation is not defined.  
// Examples of this would be expandable ads or ads that are utilizing accelerometer events where rotation would interfere with user experience.

// Either this method, fullScreenWebViewActivated, adDidExpand or handleAdMarvelSDKClick should be called on ad click where supported.
// Examples click actions that would trigger this are click to call, click to app, click to itunes, etc.  
// If the app is going to exit or go to the background the the normal UIApplicationDelegate methods will still get called after this.
// NOTE: Some ad network SDKs don't provide a tracking option for ads that don't open a full screen view so our SDK can't provide this additional information in those cases.
